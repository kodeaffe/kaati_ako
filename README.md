## Requirements

This package uses the GTK library for the GUI:

- You need to install GTK for your OS, e.g. `apt install libgtk-3-dev`.
- `gtk-rs` currently requires Rust 1.51.0 or greater, see https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk3-rs . 
  To make this available in your environment, run `rustup toolchain install 1.52.1 && rustup default 1.52.1`

  
## Database

This package uses a SQLite database.

- You might want to install a sqlite client: `apt install sqlite3`.
- Then you can run `sqlite3 kaati_ako.sqlite` to inspect the database.


## Documentation

- The autogenerated code documentation can be created by `cargo doc` or `cargo doc --open` to open them in the browser.


## Run

### From git checkout

- Simply execute `cargo run --release`.

### With installation

- If you want to install the binary to your cargo bin, run `cargo install --path .` .
- When running the binary, you should provide a path to the database file if it is not called `kaati_ako.sqlite` in your current directory, e.g. `kaati_ako --db_path=/path/to/db.sqlite`.
- You can copy the provided `assets/kaati_ako.desktop` manually into `~/.local/share/applications/` and it should be
  available by your desktop's program starter. You probably need to edit the `Exec` key for the database path.
